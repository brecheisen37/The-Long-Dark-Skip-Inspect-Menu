# Skip Inspection Menu

## Requirements
BepInEx

## Installation
1. Install MelonLoader(visit the Modding Discord for more info https://discord.gg/nHhyaPnr)
2. Drop SkipInspection.dll into Inscryption\BepInEx\plugins

## What does it do?
When you click to pick up an item such as a stick, clothing, or food, or when you open a container for the first time the inspection menu normally appears. This leads to needing to click twice for every item you want to pick up. Now that menu no longer appears, saving you from carpal tunnel.
